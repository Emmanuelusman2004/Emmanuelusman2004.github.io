    <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>Coming from a Hispanic background, my parents
        are from Colombia.I was born soon after my family moved to the U.S. in 1999, at Elmhurst Hospital in Jackson Heights 
        on February 12, 2004. I was raised in Queens, New York, before moving to my current hometown, 
        Yonkers. I went to Aviation Career & Technical High School in Long Island City, where I practiced aircraft maintenance
        and found my passion for computing while taking an introductory CS course online.
        </p>

        
        <p>My main goal is to earn my degree and support my family financially. I come from a big family with 
           three brothers and one sister. One of my goals is to help my twin brother with his tuition; he's 
           currently studying medicine at Stony Brook and aiming for med school. Knowing how expensive his career path 
           will be, I've decided to pay my own tuition so my family can support him. After I graduate and secure 
           a good job, I plan to assist him further so he can study comfortably without financial worries. Apart 
           from that, I aspire to retire early and travel the world as much as possible.

          This website was my most recent creation. I hosted using github pages
          and wrote it in a couple days. I looked at online resources
          in order to organize a professional information architecture.

          This is a project I am working on currently as part of the Rensselaer Center
          for Open Souce. Me and my team are developing a site which aids students
          who struggle searching to find information about office hours on our schools 
          fragmented system. Some Professors use blackboard, others use their own website, and
          many have it on their syllabus. We want to centralize it all in one site, SOHR(Search for Office Hours at Rensselaer).

          One of my final projects for my Information Technology course (ITWS1100) at RPI.
          Initially produced with HTML and CSS but as the semester progressed and I learned
          new tools for development I updated the site. For my final quiz I had to change the site
          to use mainly php for frontend, SQL to display my projects and store user information. hosted
          using an Azure VM.
